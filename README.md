# Getting Started

### Running Locally:
- Clone the Repo onto your local machine.
- Run ```npm i``` to install node_modules.
- Ensure you have a .env file for the ```NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL``` which is the link to your backend in this case. So for example it could be ```http://localhost:8080/api```
- Use the command ```npm run dev`` to run the frontend project locally.

### Hosting frontend:
- You can host these files on a platform like Vercel or Netlify but you need to make sure to host the backend as well or convert the backend into serverless files. 
- In our case we are hosting on vercel.
